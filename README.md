# Micropayments
### Issue
The pay-for-content business model has been a tough problem to crack for many content providers. Such content providers, usually for-profit publications such as the New York Times, Financial Times, Wall Street Journal, and many others, want to get as many eyeballs as possible, and convert them into subscribers that'll pay a monthly rate to enjoy their exclusive content. On the other hand, while there is a substantial number of consumers who do pay via subscription-based model, there are others like myself who don't find it quite worthwhile to pay, say $10/month, for a site that I'd only ever visit a few times. At the same time, I've been sent articles many times, only to have my excitement to read them curtailed by a paywall that'd be sitting right after the first paragraph or so. I am aware of the cost of producing such content and am more than willing to pay for it. However, I don't think I'd pay $10/month only to see a few articles in that period. Enter our solution.

### Solution
Our solution to the problem above is as simple as this: you give a quick micropayment to the content provider every time you want to see a piece of content. Obviously, the price that's set for a given piece of content will depend on simple economics; we wouldn't want content providers to receive less revenue as a result of this service. For those that constantly live on the Economist app and read multiple articles a day, it would probably be worthwhile to pay that subscription fee. However, for others who want to enjoy content only on occassion but are turned away by a subscription requirement, an option to send a micropayment per piece of content might result in a more efficient scenario. \
